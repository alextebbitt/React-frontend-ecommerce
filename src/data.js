        description: "Making Fabric paper to use as a background for both hand and machine embroidery is a favourite pastime. The sheer creativity involved in making these pages and the fact that I can incorporate all those beautiful napkins and scraps of wrapping paper that I have squirrelled away only serves to increase my joy!",

        description: "A recent passion is making Cloth Dolls. I used to run workshops covering the construction and the clothing of these beauties! Below you will find a selection of my favourites. They are dolls for looking at not for playing with (they are not toys). I love making their faces – I like them to be pretty, it is when I start the needle sculpting of their faces that their characters began to develop. I make their costumes at the end – they really do seem to direct me themselves!!",

        title: "Bayeux Tapestry",
        description: "The Bayeux Tapestry has always fascinated me, so when I needed to produce something for an exhibition it was a short inspirational step to base a body of work on the tapestry. I used a book by David M Wilson (which contains sizable full colour reproductions of the tapestry) to choose the images and I developed a method of reproducing them using machine embroidery. Each picture that I produced gave me such satisfaction that I wanted to keep going, but what to do with them, could I really display them all individually in frames? Then I came up with the idea of making my own book of embroideries, I made the pages from fabric paper and never looked back!",
